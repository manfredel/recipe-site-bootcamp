    <h3>Pizza Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Methods</h3>
    Step1 Preheat the oven: Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza
    stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot
    as well. Step 2 Make the sauce: If you are using my sauce recipe, stir
    together the ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large
    pizza. You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza. Step
    3 Roll out the dough: Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's
    hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature.
    For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter
    circle. Step 4 Add the toppings: Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted
    pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron. Add sauce in a
    light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the
    edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the
    pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black
    pepper. Step 5 Cook the pizza: If you're using a pizza stone, carefully
    slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6
    minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another
    6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots. If
    you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add
    toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it
    preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 ̊F
    oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Step
    6 Slice and serve: Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board.
    Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh
    oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.
