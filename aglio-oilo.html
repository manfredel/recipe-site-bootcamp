    Prep time: 10mins Cooking time: 22 mins Servings: 4 
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>   
    1 pound uncooked spaghetti 
    6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced ½ cup olive oil 
    ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    ¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 
    1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggianocheese 
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Cooking Methods <h3>
    
    Step 1 Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
    boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until
    cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to
    a pasta bowl. Step 2 Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook
    over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
    medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is
    golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Step 3 Stir red
    pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and
    garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano
    cheese; stir until combined. Step 4 Serve pasta topped with the remaining
    Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
